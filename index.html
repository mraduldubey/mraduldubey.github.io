<h1><u>Laws Of Thaladynamics</u></h1>

<ol>

  <h2><li>Absolute Zero Stress Is <s>Im</s><b>possible</b>.</li></h2>
  <p>While the absolute zero temperature is a thermodynamic impossiblility, absolute zero stress is thaladynamically achievable. Work towards calm & collected mindset.</p>

  <h2><li> Conserve Your Energy.</li></h2>
  <p>Total energy of a human being in an isolated environment is a limited resource. Conserve & channel it into constructive processes. Don't be casual with heat transfer.</p>
  
<h2><li>All Natural Processes Are Irreversible.</li></h2>
  <p>Dont sweat change. Entropy shall always increase. Let things take their natural course. Give up the illusion of absolute control. Let the universe reward you with it.</p>

<h2><li>Heat Flows from Hot To Cold bodies.</li></h2>
  <p>Hotheads will delay the equilibrium. Be a cool temperature sink.</p>

<h2><li>Idealism Is Theoretical.</li></h2>
  <p>Constant entropy needs absolute zero temperature. It's not possible, accept it. But always aim for it.</p>

<h2><li>Do Not Assume Transitive Equilibrium.</li></h2>
  <p>If two people are cool with you, they might not be cool with each other.</p>

<h2><li>Be Humble But Never Deny Your Greatness.</li></h2>
  <p>Universe is a dark cold place or it eventually will be. Do not let entropy devalue you, quit while ahead & never explain what makes you Thala for a reason.</p>
